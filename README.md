# Filemover-program
Scan selected folder for files modified in the last 24 hours, copy modified files into another selected folder
When folder is scanned a timestamp is created in a database
I used Python 3.6 and Tkinter GUI to make a small file check and copy program

*Put filepath of folder you would like to scan in the left textbox
*Put filepath of folder you would like to copy adultered files into in right textbox
*Press scan button and files created or modified in the last 24 hours will be copied.
